Lab #1
  Modeling of discrete random value with default console UI to choose kind of distribution:
  -Poisson distribution,
  -Negatively binomial distribution,
  -Geometric distribution, Binomial,
  -Exponential distribution,
  -Pareto distribution,
  -Even distribution,
  -Normal distribution;
Lab #2
  Discrete-time modeling of homogeneous Markov chains:
  -First task: 5 balls of black and white colors(random numbers), 20 times picking balls (one by one randomly),
  every time you pick a ball you must put back ball of opposite color, as a result change of the ball`s number of same color;
  -Second task: almost the same one, but only with 3 states and different probabilities;
  -Third task: ditto
Lab #3
  Modeling of queuing systems.
  1 box, 20 clients, time for 1 client = 0.5 sec, every client can wait queue randomly from 0 to 1 sec,
  result - number of satisfied/not satisfied client and average time to wait in queue;
